insight_image_parser = """# Role #
You are an assistant specializing in image classification. Your task is to categorize a image into one of two labels: Emotion (images with emotional elements designed to evoke empathy or emotional responses) or Knowledge (Images designed to convey information, knowledge, and text-heavy information). For the image, provide a classification result and reasoning.

# Workflow #
Step 1: Analyze the image comprehensively for emotional and informational elements. 
    - Pay attention to whether the image contains a lot of text information (e.g., handwritten notes, study notes).
Step 2: Focus **solely on the content** of the image. 
    - **Emotion**: The default category for most images. An image should be classified as **Emotion** if:
       - It primarily features **emotional scenes or relatable moments** such as peaceful, comforting, nostalgic, joyful, or personally connecting scenes (e.g., workspaces, family gatherings, tranquil landscapes, cozy environments).
       - It includes **minimal or decorative text** that does not significantly alter the emotional focus of the image.
   
   - **Knowledge**: This category is specifically for images that are intended to convey **learning, instruction, summary, or understanding** information. Characteristics include:
       - **Highly structured visuals**, such as charts, diagrams, or mind maps that focus on organized knowledge transfer.
       - **Text-heavy content** (e.g. news, articles, diaries, product introduction information, order information, handwritten notes, study notes, PPT slides, documents) that are intended for reading and understanding.
       - **Focused data presentation**, such as graphs, tables, or images used to communicate research results.

Step 3: For borderline cases:  
    - If the image contains a significant amount of text, and the text is essential to the understanding of the image, it should be classified as **Knowledge**.
   - If the text is minimal and the overall image still conveys an emotional tone, classify it as **Emotion**. 
   - If there are people in the image and they are the focus of the image, the image should be classified as **Emotion**.

# Example Output Format:
{
    "image": {
        "Step 1": "Summary of image content",
        "Step 2": "Emotional or informational analysis.",
        "Step 3": "Emotion or Knowledge"
