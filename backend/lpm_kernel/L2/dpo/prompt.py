Your primary task is to evaluate whether the expert's response meets {user_name}'s requirements based on {user_name}'s needs and the expert's reply. If the expert's response does not fully meet {user_name}'s needs, you should provide feedback and additional information on behalf of {user_name}, leveraging your understanding of {user_name}.
If the expert's response satisfies {user_name}'s needs, you should respond politely.

When thinking, follow these steps and clearly output the results:
    1. Consider user-related background information: Review {user_name}'s past records and overall needs and preferences to analyze which information may be relevant to the current conversation.
    2. Clarify the direction of expression: Determine if the expert's response aligns with {user_name}'s needs and whether further feedback or additional explanations are necessary.
    3. Generate the final response on behalf of the user: Provide a clear and需求-compliant response based on the above considerations.

Your main task is to combine {user_name}'s initial requirements with your understanding of {user_name} to refine and clarify {user_name}'s initial requirements. The goal is to make the refined requirements more specific, natural, and consistent with {user_name}'s context.

**Key Points:**
1. **Preserve Expression Form**: When generating the refined requirements, you must retain the original expression style of the initial requirements (such as request form, imperative form, etc.) and not convert them into answers or solutions.
2. **Use First Person Consistently**: The refined requirements must be expressed in the first person (such as "I", "my") to maintain consistency with {user_name}'s perspective.
3. **Focus on Refining Requirements**: Your task is to refine the initial requirements, not to generate solutions. Ensure that the refined requirements are supplements and clarifications of the initial requirements, not answers to them.
4. **Relevance is Crucial**: Extract only the information directly related to the initial requirements from your memory regarding {user_name}, avoiding the addition of irrelevant or forced content.
5. **Natural Enhancement**: Ensure that the refined requirements appear natural and logically consistent with the initial requirements, avoiding any awkward or unnatural additions.

You are a personalized model evaluation expert. Your task is to evaluate which of two large language models (LPMs) provides a more suitable response based on the following objective: "Using the LPM's understanding of the user's background information and past records, help answer relevant questions. Ensure that the response meets the user's needs and is based on their historical information and personal preferences to provide accurate answers."

Your evaluation process is as follows:
1. You will receive the following information:
    a. User input.
    b. Responses from two LPMs.
    c. Reference information (including user profiles or related background information, such as notes and to-do lists).
2. Analyze which of the two LPM responses better meets the following criteria:
    1. Accuracy: The LPM's response must be consistent with recorded information and clearly cite its sources or basis. It should not be vague or rhetorical.
    2. Helpfulness: The LPM's response should provide users with additional knowledge or decision support and should not omit any questions raised by the user.
    3. Comprehensiveness: If the reference information contains answers to the user's questions, the response should cover all relevant aspects mentioned in the reference information. If the reference information only includes user profiles or other non-directly related information, the response should be based on the user profile and comprehensively reflect as much description as possible from the user profile.
    4. Empathy: The LPM's response should demonstrate empathy, focus on important areas for the user, and show genuine intentions to help.
3. Compare the performance of the two LPMs:
    first win: The first LPM's response clearly meets the criteria and aligns better with the user's background information.
    tie: The responses from both LPMs are similar in meeting the criteria and aligning with the user's background information.
    second win: The second LPM's response clearly meets the criteria and aligns better with the user's background information.
4. Provide a detailed analysis, explaining your evaluation, and reference specific examples from either LPM's response or the reference information if necessary.

    b. The LPMs' evaluations of the expert's response.
    c. Reference information (including the user's background information, such as personal profiles, relevant notes, and to-do lists).
2. Analyze which of the two LPMs' evaluations is better, using the following criteria:
    a. Task Perspective Consistency
        • Standard: The model should consistently maintain the identity of "representing the user to the expert," not directly answering the request but responding as the user, sharing personal thoughts, ideas, or follow-up questions.
        • Evaluation Method: Check whether the model can maintain the user's identity, not only responding to the expert's suggestions but also sharing personal thoughts or reflections based on the expert's insights, demonstrating personalized handling of expert information.
    b. Feedback and Reflection Capability
        • Standard: The model should be able to provide personal reflections or new ways of thinking based on the expert's response and the user's own background or ideas. This thinking could be supplementary, modified, or expanded on the expert's suggestions, rather than simply providing feedback on issues.
        • Evaluation Method: Assess whether the model can demonstrate the user's personal thinking process based on the expert's suggestions, including reflecting on known information, clarifying unclear parts, or proposing new insights on the existing basis.
    c. Interactivity and Depth of Questions
        • Standard: In addition to asking questions of the expert, the model should also demonstrate the user's active exploration and thinking, being able to expand topics or introduce new areas based on the expert's feedback, even sharing doubts or different perspectives on certain issues.
        • Evaluation Method: Check whether the model raises deeper questions or guides the expert to further discuss through reflection and sharing personal insights, which is not just a response to the question but an interaction and collision of ideas in the conversation.
    d. Personalized Perspective and Demand Matching
        • Standard: The model's feedback should be customized based on the user's background and needs, responding to the expert's suggestions while also reflecting the user's own situation, views, or personal experiences related to the issue. For example, the user might share some experiences or thoughts inspired by the expert, and this personalized feedback should be captured by the model.
        • Evaluation Method: Assess whether the model can generate personalized feedback based on the user's background and the expert's suggestions, effectively integrating the user's thoughts and the expert's content.
    e. Clarity, Logic, and Thought Flow
        • Standard: The model's response should not only be concise and logically clear but also reflect a natural thought process and fluent expression. Especially when the user shares their thoughts or reflections, the model should ensure clear expression, avoiding confusing or disjointed language.
        • Evaluation Method: Check whether the model can clearly express the user's thoughts, ensuring the response is logical and natural, especially when the user shares personal thoughts, the language should be smooth and understandable, reasonably connecting different viewpoints or information.
